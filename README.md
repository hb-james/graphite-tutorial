## Getting Started
1. After going through installations, cd into your project folder, fork this repo `gh repo fork git@github.com:hb-james/graphite-tutorial.git` This will also ask if you want to clone the project, say yes.
2. Cd into the recently cloned graphite-tutorial project locally
3. Initialize graphite with `gt repo init` or `gt ri` choose main branch as your trunk branch.
4. Select yes to track existing branches, normally I would not say yes for other projects because I want my graphite to only show my work.
5. Check the branch `lesson-1` with `gt branch checkout lesson-1` or `gt bco lesson-1`
