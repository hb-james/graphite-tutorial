# Lesson 3

## A Pull Request to Main with Merge Conflict

In this lesson we will be merging branch `lesson-3` into `main`. Make sure you start this lesson on branch `lesson-3`

1. Let's create a file in the root folder of this project called `merge-conflict.md` and some content to the file.
2. Once saved, stage your recent changes through your favorite method or `git add .`
3. Lets commit our changes `gt cc -m "Added great content to lesson 1"`
4. Now we can submit our stack (stack of 1) as a PR by running `gt stack submit` or `gt ss` and follow the prompt messages.
5. Oh noes we have merge conflicts
6. To solve merge conflict first we must sync repo with the latest changes on remote with `gt repo sync` or `gt rs`
7. TODO
